Text:  Matthew 18:11 (1599 Geneva Bible)

“For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.”

In today’s text, Jesus told His disciples and us today that He came to save that which was lost, namely us.  What a difference He has made in our lives since we have come to faith in Christ.  Let us take some time today and praise Jesus for saving us from our lost condition, saving us from an eternity in the lake of fire, healing our bodies, providing our daily bread, providing companionship via a spouse, children, friends and family, and giving us His joy, etc.

Song (“What a Difference You’ve Made In My Life,” sung By B.J. Thomas, written by Archie P. Jordan — One of My Top five favorite songs): “What a difference you’ve made in my life, What a difference you’ve made in my life; You’re my sunshine day and night, Oh what a difference you’ve made in my life. What a change you have made in my heart, What a change you have made in my heart; You’ve replaced all the broken parts, Oh what a change you have made in my heart.”
